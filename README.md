## Install

For an automatic install you can use the following command:

```zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Varoso/dotfiles/master/install.sh)" 
```

**NOTE:** You can use 'wget' or 'fetch' if you don't have 'curl' installed.

After that you must install manually the iTerm color scheme.
